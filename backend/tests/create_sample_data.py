            content="""# React Hooks: A Complete Guide for Beginners

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. If you're still using class components, it's time to make the switch. This guide will get you up to speed.

## What Are React Hooks?

Hooks let you use state and other React features in functional components. They're:
- Easier to understand
- More reusable
- Better for testing

## Essential Hooks

### useState - Managing State

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect - Side Effects

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(seconds => seconds + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

Create your own hooks for reusable logic:

```jsx
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value) => {
    try {
      setStoredValue(value);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use the dependency array**: Always specify dependencies for useEffect
2. **Extract custom hooks**: Reuse stateful logic between components
3. **Keep it simple**: Don't overuse hooks where simple props would work

React Hooks make functional components more powerful than ever. Start using them today!""",

Docker has become essential for modern development. Whether you're a backend developer or full-stack engineer, understanding containers is crucial. Let's dive in!

## Why Docker?

- **Consistency**: Same environment everywhere
- **Isolation**: No more "it works on my machine"
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling
- **Deployment**: Simplified production deployments

## Getting Started

### Basic Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Docker Compose for Development

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
  
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

## Production Best Practices

### Multi-stage Builds

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Use specific image tags**: Avoid `latest`
2. **Run as non-root user**: Create dedicated user
3. **Scan for vulnerabilities**: Use tools like Snyk
4. **Minimize image size**: Use alpine images

## Deployment Strategies

### Docker Swarm
Simple orchestration for small teams

### Kubernetes
Enterprise-grade orchestration

### Cloud Services
- AWS ECS/EKS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Instances

            content="""# The Pomodoro Technique for Developers

Staying focused while coding can be challenging. Emails, Slack notifications, and that interesting Stack Overflow thread can derail your productivity. The Pomodoro Technique might be the solution you need.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

Developed by Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses 25-minute focused work periods followed by 5-minute breaks.

### The Basic Steps

1. **Choose a task** to work on
2. **Set a timer** for 25 minutes
3. **Work on the task** until the timer rings
4. **Take a 5-minute break**
5. **Repeat** 3 more times
6. **Take a longer break** (15-30 minutes)

## Adapting Pomodoros for Development

### Task Breakdown

Not all coding tasks fit neatly into 25 minutes:

- **Bug fixes**: Usually perfect for one pomodoro
- **New features**: Break into smaller sub-tasks
- **Research**: Set specific research goals
- **Code reviews**: Group similar PRs together

### Tools for Developers

#### Timer Apps
- **Forest**: Gamified focus with virtual trees
- **Toggl**: Time tracking with pomodoro features
- **Be Focused**: Simple, clean interface

#### IDE Integration
- **VS Code extensions**: Pomodoro Timer, Tomato Timer
- **IntelliJ plugins**: Pomodoro Timer Pro
- **Vim plugins**: For the terminal enthusiasts

### Handling Interruptions

In development, interruptions are inevitable:

**Internal interruptions** (ideas, distractions):
- Write them down quickly
- Return to your current task
- Address during breaks

**External interruptions** (meetings, urgent bugs):
- If it takes less than 2 minutes, handle it
- Otherwise, schedule it for after your pomodoro

## Customizing for Your Workflow

### Different Time Intervals

Experiment with different durations:
- **50/10 minutes**: Better for complex debugging
- **90 minutes**: For deep, creative work
- **15/5 minutes**: When you're struggling to focus

### Team Pomodoros

Try synchronized pomodoros with your team:
- Shared focus time
- Coordinated breaks
- Better for pair programming

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Being too rigid**: Adapt the technique to your needs
2. **Ignoring breaks**: Breaks are crucial for sustained focus
3. **Overestimating tasks**: Better to finish early than stress about time
4. **Multitasking**: Stick to one task per pomodoro

## Measuring Success

Track your pomodoros to improve:
- **Completed pomodoros per day**
- **Types of tasks** that work best
- **Time of day** when you're most productive
- **Interruption patterns**

## The Developer's Advantage

Developers already think in terms of:
- Breaking down complex problems
- Iterative improvement
- Measuring and optimizing

The Pomodoro Technique fits naturally into this mindset.

## Getting Started

1. **Start small**: Try just 4 pomodoros your first day
2. **Track your results**: Note what works and what doesn't
3. **Adjust as needed**: Make the technique work for you
4. **Be consistent**: Give it at least a week before judging

The Pomodoro Technique isn't magic, but it's a proven way to boost focus and productivity. Give it a try‚Äîyour future, more productive self will thank you.
